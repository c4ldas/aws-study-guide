- [ ] IAM: users, groups, policies, roles
- [ ] AWS CLI basics

### Practice:
- [ ] Create IAM users with limited permissions
- [ ] Use AWS CLI to create an S3 bucket

### Learn:
- [ ] EC2 instance types, AMIs, key pairs, security groups

### Practice:
- [ ] Launch an EC2 instance
- [ ] SSH into it and install a web server (Apache/Nginx)
- [ ] Modify security group rules (open/close ports)

---

## ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ S3 + CloudWatch
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) - For object storage, backups, and data management.
- CloudWatch - For monitoring resources, logs, and setting up alerts.
### Learn:
- [ ] S3 buckets, objects, versioning, lifecycle
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms

### Practice:
- [ ] Upload/download files via CLI
- [ ] Create CPU alarm for EC2
- [ ] Explore CloudWatch logs

---

## ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ VPC + Subnets + Routing
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - For networking, creating isolated environments, and securing your resources.
### Learn:
- [ ] VPC, public/private subnets, routing, internet/NAT gateways

### Practice:
- [ ] Create VPC with 2 subnets (public/private)
- [ ] Launch EC2 in each, test internet access
- [ ] Add NAT Gateway and route outbound traffic

---

## ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ Route 53 + ELB
- Route 53 - DNS and domain management service, which also includes routing traffic efficiently.
- ELB (Elastic Load Balancing) - Used for distributing incoming application traffic across multiple targets, ensuring high availability.
### Learn:
- [ ] Route 53: hosted zones, A/CNAME records
- [ ] Elastic Load Balancing: ALB basics

### Practice:
- [ ] Host static site on S3 + Route 53 DNS
- [ ] Launch EC2 with ALB and test routing

---

## ðŸ“… Day 6 â€“ RDS (Databases)
- RDS (Relational Database Service) - Important for managing databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server in the cloud.
### Learn:
- [ ] RDS: instance types, backups, endpoints
- [ ] DB subnet groups, security

### Practice:
- [ ] Launch RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Connect via client (DBeaver/MySQL CLI)
- [ ] Test access with security groups

---

## ðŸ“… Day 7 â€“ Lambda + S3 Trigger
- Lambda - Serverless compute service, helpful in scenarios where you need to run code without managing servers.
### Learn:
- [ ] Lambda functions and triggers
- [ ] S3 event notifications

### Practice:
- [ ] Create basic Lambda function
- [ ] Trigger on S3 file upload
- [ ] Log output to CloudWatch

---

## ðŸ“… Day 8 â€“ CloudFormation + AWS Support Tools
- CloudFormation - For infrastructure as code, automating the deployment and management of resources.
### Learn:
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation basics)
- [ ] AWS Trusted Advisor, Health Dashboard

### Practice:
- [ ] Deploy simple EC2 stack using CloudFormation
- [ ] Review Trusted Advisor findings

---

## ðŸ“… Day 9 â€“ Troubleshooting & Security
### Learn:
- [ ] Common AWS support scenarios
- [ ] IAM: identity vs resource-based policies

### Practice:
- [ ] Simulate "access denied" (S3, EC2, RDS)
- [ ] Fix security group or IAM permission errors

---

## ðŸ“… Day 10 â€“ Review & Mock Interview
### Review:
- [ ] Summarize each service: what, when, how
- [ ] Go over your practice setups
- [ ] Build a personal AWS cheatsheet

### Optional:
- [ ] Take an AWS quiz or mock interview
- [ ] Review documentation bookmarks
