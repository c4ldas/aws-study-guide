## 🪣 S3 Buckets

Buckets are containers for storing objects in Amazon S3.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Each bucket name must be globally unique.
- Bucket names follow DNS naming conventions (e.g., `my-awesome-bucket`).
- Buckets are region-specific.
- You can set permissions and policies at the bucket level.
- Buckets can host static websites.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You create a bucket called `company-assets` in `us-east-1` to store media files used across your web apps.

---

## 📦 S3 Objects

Objects are the actual data stored in buckets.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Each object has:
  - A key (unique identifier within a bucket).
  - The actual data (file content).
  - Metadata (standard and custom).
- Objects can be versioned if versioning is enabled.
- Maximum object size: 5TB (uploads >5GB use multipart upload).

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You upload `logo.png` with key `images/logo.png` to your bucket. You add custom metadata like `x-amz-meta-owner: marketing`.

---

## 🔁 Versioning

Versioning allows multiple variants of the same object to exist in a bucket.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Enables protection against accidental overwrites or deletions.
- Every version has a unique version ID.
- Delete operations just add a *delete marker*, they don’t remove old versions.
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled—only suspended.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You accidentally overwrite `report.pdf`. Thanks to versioning, you can recover the previous version from the S3 console.

---

## ♻ Lifecycle Rules

Lifecycle rules automate transitions between storage classes and deletion of objects.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Define rules to:
  - Transition objects to cheaper storage (e.g., S3 Glacier, S3 IA).
  - Delete objects or expired versions after a set number of days.
- Rules can apply to current versions, previous versions, or both.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You set a rule to move logs to Glacier after 30 days and permanently delete them after 365 days.


## 🔧 Hands-On: S3 with AWS CLI

### 🪣 S3 Buckets

#### ✅ Create a new S3 bucket
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-example-bucket --region us-east-1
```
#### ✅ List all buckets
```bash
aws s3api list-buckets
```
#### ✅ Delete a bucket
```bash
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket my-example-bucket
```
---

### 📦 S3 Objects

#### ✅ Upload a file to a bucket
```bash
aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-example-bucket/
```
#### ✅ Download a file from a bucket
```bash
aws s3 cp s3://my-example-bucket/myfile.txt .
```
#### ✅ Delete an object
```bash
aws s3api delete-object --bucket my-example-bucket --key myfile.txt
```
---

### 🌀 Versioning

#### ✅ Enable versioning on a bucket
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-example-bucket --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```
#### ✅ Get the versioning status
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-example-bucket
```
#### ✅ List object versions
```bash
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket my-example-bucket
```
---

### 📆 Lifecycle

#### ✅ Add a lifecycle rule (e.g., delete files after 30 days)
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-example-bucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```
> 💡 Example `lifecycle.json`:
```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "DeleteOldObjects",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Prefix": "",
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### ✅ Get lifecycle configuration
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-example-bucket
```

#### ✅ Delete lifecycle configuration
```bash
aws s3api delete-bucket-lifecycle --bucket my-example-bucket
```

In summary, S3 provides a powerful and flexible storage system. Understanding buckets, objects, versioning, and lifecycle rules helps you efficiently manage storage costs, data durability, and recoverability.
