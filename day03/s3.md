## 🪣 S3 Buckets

Buckets are containers for storing objects in Amazon S3.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Each bucket name must be globally unique.
- Bucket names follow DNS naming conventions (e.g., `my-awesome-bucket`).
- Buckets are region-specific.
- You can set permissions and policies at the bucket level.
- Buckets can host static websites.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You create a bucket called `company-assets` in `us-east-1` to store media files used across your web apps.

## 📦 S3 Objects

Objects are the actual data stored in buckets.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Each object has:
  - A key (unique identifier within a bucket).
  - The actual data (file content).
  - Metadata (standard and custom).
- Objects can be versioned if versioning is enabled.
- Maximum object size: 5TB (uploads >5GB use multipart upload).

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You upload `logo.png` with key `images/logo.png` to your bucket. You add custom metadata like `x-amz-meta-owner: marketing`.

## 🔁 Versioning

Versioning allows multiple variants of the same object to exist in a bucket.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Enables protection against accidental overwrites or deletions.
- Every version has a unique version ID.
- Delete operations just add a *delete marker*, they don’t remove old versions.
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled—only suspended.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You accidentally overwrite `report.pdf`. Thanks to versioning, you can recover the previous version from the S3 console.

## ♻️ Lifecycle Rules

Lifecycle rules automate transitions between storage classes and deletion of objects.

### 💡 Key Points:
- Define rules to:
  - Transition objects to cheaper storage (e.g., S3 Glacier, S3 IA).
  - Delete objects or expired versions after a set number of days.
- Rules can apply to current versions, previous versions, or both.

### 🌐 Example Use Case:
You set a rule to move logs to Glacier after 30 days and permanently delete them after 365 days.

In summary, S3 provides a powerful and flexible storage system. Understanding buckets, objects, versioning, and lifecycle rules helps you efficiently manage storage costs, data durability, and recoverability.
